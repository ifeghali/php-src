Things to do or at least think about doing in the future. Name in
parenthesis means that person has taken on this project.

global
------
    * let every module (source-file) have it's own module & function_entry 
      block. Right now the math functions are in math.c but the corresponding
      function-entries are in basic_functions.
    * make sure that all ZTS globals get destructed. Most ts_allocate_id()
      calls should have a dtor entry.
    * activate all extensions by default that don't rely on external
      dependices. (eg ftp)
    * --enable-all in configure. (--enable-shared=max ...)
    * make configure print out a summary when it's done (like XEmacs)
    * replace standard functions which work on static data with 
      reentrant-save functions
    * there is only one current directory per process; to make
      chdir() etc. thread-safe, we must introduce a per-thread
      current directory
    * on some platforms unimplemented function will just do nothing (eg symlink)
      they should print a warning or be not even defined!
    * banish the legacy of php3_ prefixes
    * implement javadoc based function docs template system
    * use thread-safe resolver functions (either require BIND 8 or adns)
    * provide optional IPv6 support
    * make SAPI conform to CGI/1.1. Currently, all SAPI modules
      define REMOTE_ADDR etc. themselves and reach only various level
      of compliance.

documentation
-------------
    * add remarks in the documentation which functions are not implemented on win32.
    * add remarks in the documentation which functions are not binary-safe.

ext/wddx
--------
	* implement wddx_packet_as_javascript(). (Andrei)

ext/apache
--------
    * all apache specific functions should be in sapi/apache

ext/oci8
--------
    * map boolean value false to oracle NULL.
    * all OCIFetch*() functions should return 0 for no more data and false on error.

ext/standard
------------
    * strpad() (Andrei)
    * stri_replace() (Andrei)
    * realpath() (Andrei)
    * comparing arrays semantically (like Python) (Andrei)
    * NOT binary safe:
        strtok()
        basename()
        dirname()
        strrpos()
        strrchr()
        strip_tags()
