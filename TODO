Things to do or at least think about doing in the future. Name in
parenthesis means that person has taken on this project.

global
------
    * replace standard functions which work on static data with 
      reentrant-save functions
    * there is only one current directory per process; to make
      chdir() etc. thread-safe, we must introduce a per-thread
      current directory
	* on some platforms unimplemented function will just do nothing (eg symlink)
	  they should print a warning or be not even defined!

documentation
-------------
	* add remarks in the documentation which functions are not implemented on win32.
	* add remarks in the documentation which functions are not binary-safe.

ext/standard
------------
	* strpad() (Andrei)
    * advanced sort (Andrei)
	* make all string functions binary-safe.
