Things to do or at least think about doing in the future. Name in
parenthesis means that person has taken on this project.

global
------
    * replace standard functions which work on static data with 
      reentrant-save functions
    * there is only one current directory per process; to make
      chdir() etc. thread-safe, we must introduce a per-thread
      current directory
    * on some platforms unimplemented function will just do nothing (eg symlink)
      they should print a warning or be not even defined!
	* banish the legacy of php3_ prefixes
	* implement javadoc based function docs template system

documentation
-------------
    * add remarks in the documentation which functions are not implemented on win32.
    * add remarks in the documentation which functions are not binary-safe.

ext/oci8
--------
	* map boolean value false to oracle NULL.
	* all OCIFetch*() functions should return 0 for no more data and false on error.

ext/standard
------------
    * strpad() (Andrei)
	* comparing arrays semantically (like Python) (Andrei)
	* NOT binary safe:
		strtok()
		basename()
		dirname()
		strrpos()
		strrchr()
		quotemeta()
		strip_tags()
