* define PEAR_INSTALL_DIR, PHP_EXTENSION_DIR, PHP_BINDIR and more
  in main/main.c

* always build CGI (--disable-cgi option to disable)

* clean up installation directories, start using proper autoconf
  directories: php.ini goes into $sysconfdir, PEAR stuff goes into
  $datadir[/php]/pear, extensions go into $libdir[/php]/<apispec>.

* move most extensions and PEAR packages out of the PHP CVS tree,
  include them again during release packaging

* renaming functions so that they all are conform to one standard form

* allow foreach($array as $key => &$value)

* allow foreach($array as list($var1, $var2))

* clean up "$instance = &new object" syntax.
