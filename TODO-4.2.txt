* always build CGI (--disable-cgi option to disable)

* move most extensions and PEAR packages out of the PHP CVS tree,
  include them again during release packaging

* renaming functions so that they all are conform to one standard form

* allow foreach($array as $key => &$value)

* allow foreach($array as list($var1, $var2))

* clean up "$instance = &new object" syntax (default to the =& behaviour?)
