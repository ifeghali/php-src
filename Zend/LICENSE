Zend Temporary License
======================

This is a temporary license, that is in effect until the final Zend license
is available.

* The final license will include the ability to distribute Zend freely,
  as a part of PHP (in both compiled and source code formats).  It may
  (and probably will) allow to redistribute Zend under other circumstances
  as well, but at the very least, it'll be freely distributed as a part
  of PHP.

* The source code in the Zend engine is the property of Andi Gutmans and
  Zeev Suraski.  Parts of this code are based on source code taken from
  PHP 3.0, which may include several patches and enhancements that weren't
  made by us (Andi&Zeev).  If you're the author of such a patch and you're
  not willing to give up ownership over your patch to us, please contact
  us as soon as possible, so we can remove it.  We're doing this so that
  we'd be eligible to sell the Zend engine for uses other than PHP, most
  notably - as an embedded part of possible commercial products that we'd
  have.

* Patches submitted to the Zend CVS automatically fall under this license,
  and by submitting them you're implicitly giving up your ownership over
  this patch to us.

* Until further notice, Zend is in a status of a closed beta test.  That means
  that only people that were explicitly given the right to access the Zend
  CVS repository are allowed to use it.  If you're reading this file and you
  weren't explicitly given the right to access the Zend CVS repository from
  either Andi Gutmans or Zeev Suraski - you're not supposed to have it - please
  erase the Zend files from your system.  When the closed beta period finishes,
  the Zend CVS tree will be open for the public (in read-only mode, of course).
