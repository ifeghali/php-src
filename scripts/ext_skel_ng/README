sorry, no real documentation yet ...
just a short look at what is going on

ext_skel_ng.php gets an extension description
from an "extension.xml" file and generates working
code and documentation stubs from that

call "php ext_skel_ng.php" to see it at work,
it will create a dummy extension including 

- module globals and ini paramter setup
- function registration and stubbs
- documentation framework
- config.m4 (only minimal for now)
- ...

almost every aspect of an extension may now be 
configured using one xml description file instead
of the old mixture of command line parameters
and a proto file

it is even possible to embed function code into
the xml description right away, so it should be
possible to create complete working extensions
from just the xml description without further
editing in a not to distant future

for now almost all the 'helpfull comments' have 
been removed from the generated code. some of
them (like 'uncomment this if you have ini params)
just don't make sense anymore, others will come
back (configurable) at a later state 

... have fun!
