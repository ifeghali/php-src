Each SAPI backend has to contain:

config.m4: just like for extensions, this file contains
autoconf/automake directives that end up in the configure script.  The
only difference is that the sapi config.m4 files are read in diversion
(output block) 2 instead of 3.  The sapi config.m4 files should set
two variables: PHP_SAPI (which sapi backend to choose) and SAPI_TARGET
(the name of the resulting library or program, previously BINNAME).
If they are not specified, they will default to "cgi" and "php",
respectively.

Makefile.inc: has to exist, has to define "INSTALL_IT" to the command
used to install the final target (or ":" for no operation).  It also
has to define a plain Makefile rule (without autoconf substitutions)
to build $(SAPI_TARGET)

Makefile.am: just what you think.  Make sure your target is called
"libphpsapi_NNN.a", where NNN is the value of PHP_SAPI.
