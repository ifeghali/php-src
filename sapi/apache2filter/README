WHAT IS THIS?

    It is an output filter for Apache 2.0.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
    
    In Apache 2.0, you have handlers which generate content (like
    reading a script from disk). The content goes then through
    a chain of filters. PHP can be such a filter, so that it processes
    your script and hands the output to the next filter (which will
    usually cause a write to the network).

DOES IT WORK?

    It is experimental as interfaces in Apache 2.0 might change in the
    future.

HOW TO INSTALL

    Get the latest Apache 2.0 alpha or the CVS code and install it.

        $ cd apache-2.x
        $ cd src
        $ ./configure --enable-so
        $ make install

    For testing purposes, you might want to use --with-mpm=prefork.
    (Albeit PHP also works with threaded MPMs.)

    Configure PHP 4:

        $ cd php-4.x
        $ ./configure --with-apxs2=/path/to/apache-2.0/bin/apxs
        $ make install
   
    APXS is currently still flaky, so edit conf/httpd.conf and change
    the LoadModule entry from libphp4.la to libphp4.so.

    At the end of conf/httpd.conf, add:

        <Files *.php>
        AddOutputFilter PHP
        </Files>

    That's it. Now start bin/httpd.

    If you want to debug Apache, set ONE_PROCESS in your environment 
    (comparable to -X in Apache 1.3). We recommened the prefork MPM 
    for debugging purposes.
