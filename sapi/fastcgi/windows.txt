Windows support is currently experimental.

Tested under IIS with cgi-fcgi.exe and Apache with mod_fastcgi.

Compilation:
Currently only supports Non-Thread safe compilation, however, 
that is realy all that is needed :)

Get the devkit from www.fastcgi.com, build it.
Create the directories 
	php4/sapi/fastcgi/fcgi
	php4/sapi/fastcgi/fcgi/include
	php4/sapi/fastcgi/fcgi/lib
Place headers and libs in the include and lib directories.
Load the php.dsw, and compile.

IIS configuration:

Under the application configuration in the IIS configuration program, use:
.php C:\php-fcgi\cgi-fcgi.exe -connect php c:\php-fcgi\php-fcgi.exe

Apache Configuration:

LoadModule fastcgi_module  modules/mod_fastcgi.dll
<IfModule mod_fastcgi.c>
AddHandler fastcgi-script fphp php
</IfModule>

The scripts require the bang line as the first line
of the script to work with mod_fastcgi,
#!c:/php-fcgi/php-fcgi.exe

TODO:
make 'thread-safe' compilation, though it isn't necessary.
