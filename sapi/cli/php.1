.SH DESCRIPTION
.B PHP
is a widely\-used general\-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for 
Web development and can be embedded into HTML. This is the command line interface
that enables you to the following:
.P
You can parse and execute files by using parameter \-f followed by the name of the 
.IR file 
to be executed.
.LP
Using parameter \-r you can directly execute PHP 
.IR code 
simply as you would do inside a .php file when using the 
.B eval() 
function.
.LP
It is also possible to process the standard input line by line using either
the parameter \-R or \-F. In this mode each separate input line causes the
.IR code 
specified by \-R or the 
.IR file
specified by \-F to be executed.
You can access the input line by \fB$argn\fP. While processing the input lines
.B $argi 
contains the number of the actual line being processed. Further more
the paramters \-B and \-E can be used to execute 
.IR code
(see \-r) before and
after all input lines have been processed respectively.
.LP
If none of \-r \-f \-B \-R \-F or \-E is present but a single parameter is given 
then this parameter is taken as the filename to parse and execute (same as 
with \-f). If no parameter is present then the standard input is read and 
executed.

.SH FILES
.TP 15
.B php\-cli.ini
The configuration file for the CLI version of PHP.
.TP
.B php.ini
The standard configuration file will only be used when 
.B php\-cli.ini
cannot not be found.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP 5
php \-r 'echo "Hello World\\n";'
This command simply writes the text "Hello World" to stabdard out.
.TP
php \-r 'print_r(gd_info());'
This shows the configuration of your gd extension. You can use this
to easily check which imag formats you can use. If you have any
dynamic modules you may want to use the same ini file that php uses
when executed from your webserver. There are more extensions which
have such a function. For dba use php \-r 'print_r(dba_handlers(1));'
.TP
php \-d html_errors=1 \-i | php \-R 'echo strip_tags($argn)."\\n";'
This example uses PHP first to generate a HTML output. This is 
meant to be replaced with any tool that displays HTML (for instance
you could use 'cat file.html'). The second php command now strips off
the HTML tags line by line and outputs the result.
.TP
php \-E 'echo "Lines: $argi\\n";'
This command shows the number of lines being input.
.TP
php \-R '$l+=count(file($argn));' \-E'echo "Lines:$l\\n";'
This commands expects each input line beeing a file. It counts all lines 
of the files specified by each input line and shows the summarized result. 
You may combine this with tools like find and change the php scriptlet.
.TP
php \-R 'echo $argn; fgets(STDIN);'
Since you have access to STDIN from within \-B \-R and \-F you can skip certain
input lines with your code. But note that in such cases $argi only counts the
lines being processed by php itself. Having read this you will guess what the 
above program does: skipping every second input line.
.SH TIPS
You can use a shebang line to automatically invoke php
from scripts. Only the CLI version of PHP will ignore
such a first line as shown below:
.P
.PD 0
#!/bin/php
.P
<?php
.P
 // your script
.P
?>
