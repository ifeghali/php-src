Configuration of your Netscape/SunONE/iPlanet Web Server for PHP4
-------------------------------------------------------------

These instructions are targetted at Netscape Enterprise Web Server and
SUN/Netscape Alliance iPlanet Web Server/SunONE Webserver.
On other web servers your milage may vary.

Firstly you may need to add some paths to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment for Netscape to find all the shared libs. This is best done
in the start script for your Netscape server.  Windows users can
probably skip this step. The start script is located in:

    <path-to-netscape-server>/https-servername/start


Netscape/iPlanet/SunONE config files are located in:

    <path-to-server>/https-servername/config


Add the following line to mime.types (you can do that by the administration server):

    type=magnus-internal/x-httpd-php	exts=php


Place the following two lines after mime.types init in
<path-to-server>/https-servername/config/obj.conf (for servers < 6) or
for iPlanet/SunONE Web Server 6.0 and above however at the end of the
<path-to-server>/https-servername/config/magnus.conf file:

    Init fn="load-modules" funcs="php4_init,php4_execute,php4_auth_trans" shlib="/path/to/phplibrary"
    Init fn=php4_init errorString="Failed to initialize PHP!" [php_ini="/path/to/php.ini"]

The "shlib" will vary depending on your OS:

	Unix: "<path-to-server>/bin/libphp4.so".
	Windows: "c:/path/to/PHP4/nsapiPHP4.dll"


In obj.conf (for virtual server classes [SunONE 6.0] in their vserver.obj.conf):

    <Object name="default">
    .
    .
    .
    # NOTE this next line should happen after all 'ObjectType' and before
    # all 'AddLog' lines
    # You can modify some entries in php.ini request specific by adding it to the Service
    # directive, e.g. doc_root="/path"
    # For boolean ini-keys please use 0/1 as value, NOT "On","Off",... (this will not work
    # correctly), e.g. zlib.output_compression=1 instead of zlib.output_compression="On"

    Service fn="php4_execute" type="magnus-internal/x-httpd-php" [inikey=value ...]
    .
    .
    .
    </Object>

This is only needed if you want to configure a directory that only consists of
PHP scripts (same like a cgi-bin directory):

    <Object name="x-httpd-php">
    ObjectType fn="force-type" type="magnus-internal/x-httpd-php"
    Service fn="php4_execute" [inikey=value ...]
    </Object>

After that you can configure a directory in the Administration server and assign it
the style "x-httpd-php". All files in it will get executed as PHP. This is nice to
hide PHP usage by renaming files to .html


Authentication configuration
----------------------------

PHP authentication cannot be used with any other authentication.  ALL
AUTHENTICATION IS PASSED TO YOUR PHP SCRIPT.  To configure PHP
Authentication for the entire server, add the following line:

    <Object name="default">
    AuthTrans fn=php4_auth_trans
    .
    .
    .
    .
    </Object>


To use PHP Authentication on a single directory, add the following:

    <Object ppath="d:\path\to\authenticated\dir\*">
    AuthTrans fn=php4_auth_trans
    </Object>
