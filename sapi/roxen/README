Roxen PHP support. Early version. Don't expect to be able to get it to
work. Requires Pike 0.7.79 and Roxen 1.4. Anything less won't work.

The module is now thread safe, in a couple of different modes. First
mode, the default, uses a process global PHP lock in the Roxen
module. This means that all PHP-requests are serialized (ie only one
script is executed at any one time). The second option is using ZTS
(Zend Thread Safe mode). Unless --enable-roxen-zts is specified, this
won't be used. For now this uses a global lock in the PHP interpreter
so the end result is the same (only one concurrent script). In the
future this might change though, but for now you are better off using
the non-ZendThreadSafe version (which works fine with Roxen and
threads).
