This stress test program is for debugging threading issues with the isapi module.

2 ways to use it.

1: test any php script file on multiple threads
2: run the php test scripts bundled with the source code


GLOBAL SETTINGS

If you need to set special environement variables, in addition to your regular environment, create a file that contains them, one setting per line:

MY_ENV_VAR=XXXXXXXX

This can be used to simulate isapi environment variables if need be.

By default, stress test uses 10 threads.  To change this, change the define NUM_THREADS in stresstest.cpp.

1: test any php script file on multiple threads

Create a file that contains a list of php script files, one per line.  If you need to provide input, place the GET data, or Query String, after the filename.  File contents would look like:

e:\inetpub\pages\index.php
e:\inetpub\pages\info.php
e:\inetpub\pages\test.php a=1&b=2

run: stresstest L files.txt

2: run the php test scripts bundled with the source code

supply the path to the parent of the "tests" directory
(expect a couple long pauses for a couple of the larger tests)

run: stresstest T c:\php4-source



TODO:

Make more options configurable: number of threads, itterations, etc.

Improve stdout output to make it more usefull

Implement support for SKIPIF

Improve speed of CompareFile function (too slow on big files).
