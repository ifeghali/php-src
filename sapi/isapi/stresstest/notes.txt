This stress test program is for debugging threading issues with the isapi module.

Create a file that contains a list of php script files, one per line.  If you need to provide input, you can create an input file for each script file.  File contents would look like:

e:\inetpub\pages\index.php
e:\inetpub\pages\info.php
e:\inetpub\pages\posttest.php e:\inetpub\pages\postdata.txt

If you need to set special environement variables, in addition to your regular environment, create a file that contains them, one setting per line:

MY_ENV_VAR=XXXXXXXX

This can be used to simulate isapi environment variables if need be.

By default, stress test uses 10 threads.  To change this, change the define NUM_THREADS in stresstest.cpp.

This test program is a work in progress, no garauntees on it working right.
