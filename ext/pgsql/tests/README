Test scripts assume: 
 - PostgreSQL server is installed locally
 - there is a PostgreSQL account for the users running test script 
 - there is database named "test"

For instance, if you login name is 'testuser', you should
have PostgreSQL user account named 'testuser' and have 'test'
database.

If you have account and database, type "createdb test" from
command prompt to create database to execute test scripts.

If you find problems in PostgreSQL module, please mail to
yohgaki@php.net or php-dev@lists.php.net.
