1) Implement the following list entries and thier destructors:
	le_domxmlnotationp

2) Use ZEND_FETCH_RESOURCE() macros instead of custom functions.
3) Implement those classes we really want, kill all of the rest.
4) Remove debug code (many calls to fprintf()).
5) Make 1st arg always be the object. This is currently half-and-half, or so.
6) Take a hard look at startup/shutdown code. This is really running slower than
	it ought to be.
7) Fix the many, many memory leaks.
8) Modify new_child to allow creation of attribute, cdata, dtd, etc nodes.
