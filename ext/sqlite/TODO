- Implement an aggregating php function handler for use in SQL statements and
  triggers etc.

- Add user-space callback for the authorizer function (this is potentially
  very slow, so it needs to be implemented carefully).

- Add an unbuffered query mode to stream data through PHP, rather than
  fetching it all at the start.
