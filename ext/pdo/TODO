In no particular order:

Low-level:

- Scanner for :named placeholders and prepare()/execute() emulation (George)
- $dbh->quote()
- Exceptions and unified error API
- Scrollable cursors
- meta data from driver, such as server version and supported features
- field meta data from statement handles
- $dbh->exec() for one-shot SQL
- LOB support via Streams API
- persistent handles
- iterator support
- "lazy" fetch support

Not-so-low-level:
- hash key case folding for portabilitiy, ala sqlite.assoc_case, but not using an ini option.
- fetchAll(), single row, single column fetches etc.

Could be more...
