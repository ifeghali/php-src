README file for pspell (spellchecker) module for PHP4
-----------------------------------------------------

The latest release of pspell is always available from

  http://pspell.sourceforge.net/

This module was developed and tested with aspell-.31.1 and pspell-.11.0.2,
although slightly earlier (and hopefully later) versions of those libraries
should work as well.

General notes
-------------

Plese, note that somewhere around version .27.x (I believe) aspell stopped
working with the aspell module for php. This is due to the fact that the
author changed things around a bit, and suggested that people link to pspell
in the future rather than to aspell. That's exactly what this module is for.
It has the same basic functionality as aspell (and more features are being
added). I did not want to modify existing aspell module, because it would
break things for those who are using older aspell, or result in very ugly code.
Rather, I wrote a new module - pspell.


Building pspell on a Unix system
--------------------------------

In order to use pspell, you need to have *both* aspell and pspell libraries
installed, and they have to be compatible with each other. Get the latest
release of both at the URL given above.

I expect the libraries to be in /usr/local (that's the default when you
cofigure pspell and aspell with their 'configure' scripts woth no parameters).
If that location is different, please specify it in --with-pspell=PATH, where
PATH is the path you specified for pspell libraries.
