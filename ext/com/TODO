1) Multi-dimenstional array support
2) IErrorInfo
3) WithEvents
4) Documentation (internal and user) and howtos
5) IEnumVariant::All() which would be like IEnumVariant::Next(IDispatch::Count)
6) Look for memory leaks and AdRef/Release problems - I KNOW there are some...
7) Test component (goes with the docs)
8) Test suite (Needs test component)
9) reduce the need for VARIANT()
10) lets try if we are able to call non IDispatch - only Typelib components
11) IEnumVariant::Next() without parameter should only return an object, not an array with one element
