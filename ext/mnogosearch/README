mnoGoSearch extension module for PHP4.
Basic mnoGoSearch function implementation.

If used with mysql you should not use bundled mysql library 
in the php distribution. You should use native mysql 
library. To do this you should compile php with specefying mysql-dir
(for example --with-mysql=/usr, not --with-mysql).

  TODO
  ----

1. Implement more mnoGoSearch functions.

2. Fix  config.m4 to detect whether mnoGoSearch is actually installed.
Currently there is no any checking. ./configure just trust that mnoGoSearch
does exist.

3. Test with more databases. Currently tested with MySQL.
Actually it should work fine with other supported databases.

4. Write PHP interface documentation.
