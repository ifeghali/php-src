mnoGoSearch extension module version 0.3 for PHP4.
Basic mnoGoSearch function implementation.

If used with mysql you should not use bundled mysql library 
in the php distribution. You should use native mysql 
library. To do this you should compile php with specefying mysql-dir
(for example --with-mysql=/usr, not --with-mysql).

  TODO
  ----

1. Implement more UdmSearch functions. Only basic minimal functions
set is implemented for now.

2. Fix  config.m4 to detect whether UdmSearch is actually installed.
Currently there is no any checking. ./configure just trust that UdmSearch
does exist.

3. Test with more databases. Currently tested with MySQL which is compiled into
PHP4 by default and does not require any additional UdmSearch libraries.
  Actually it should work fine with other supported database.

4. Write PHP interface documentation.

5. Add nice warnings when unknown parameters are passed to PHP functions.
Those places are marked with FIXME is php_udm.c
