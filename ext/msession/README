This is msession, it is an interface to a stand-alone session
management system. The msession daemon can be found at 
Mohawk Software's web site, under Project Phoenix

http://www.mohawksoft.com/phoenix.html

Requirements:
Mohawk Software's Phoenix library.
Mohawk Software's msession daemon.


Building:
I (regretfully) have not invested the time to make all 
this stuff automatic.

In the config.m4 file you will need to specify the include 
and library directories for Phoenix. The setting in config.m4
is probably wrong.
