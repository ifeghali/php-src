This is msession, it is an interface to a stand-alone session
management system. The msession daemon can be found at 
Mohawk Software's web site, under Project Phoenix

http://www.mohawksoft.com/phoenix.html

Requirements:
Mohawk Software's Phoenix library.
Mohawk Software's msession daemon.

Building:
In the config.m4 file you will need to specify the include 
and library directories for Phoenix. The setting in config.m4
is probably wrong.

You will need phoenix installed and built to compile this
module.
