json-c fork - Omar Kilani <omar[at]rmilk[dot]com>
----------------------------------------------------

As development on json-c has apparently seized, I have, in the course
of debugging the JSON PHP extension, modified the source herein to
address a variety of issues. As such, if you have any issues with
*this* copy of json-c, you should contact me at the address listed
above, instead of the original authors of this software.
