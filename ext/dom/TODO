1) Change _node_list_pointer to something faster than just a linked list.
	Currently there to test that unlinked node tracking works
2) Possible create new object type for documents as these are the only types which need to track nodes
	- Would also require its own dtor functionality
3) Define correct behavior. When certain types of nodes are destroyed, 
	do we unlink children (if referenced) or just destroy them. (Element/Attribute nodes)
4) Find out where XPath goes (this extension or its own)
5) What DOM object types are really needed (i.e. not currently using DOMString)
6) Determine how to handle non speced functionality.
	i.e validation (add method or implement as property for processing)
