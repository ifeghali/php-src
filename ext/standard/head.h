   We are still using a PHP2-style Push/Pop list here as opposed
   to the PHP3 built-in list functionality because of the nature
   of this particular list.  It is just used as a structured
   buffer.  Doing this with the built-in list code would require
   some changes to allow a search for the first item with a
   certain type.  This type of search would not be optimal.
   Private list management makes more sense here
