/**
 * @brief   Iterator to filter recursive iterators
 * @author  Marcus Boerger
 * @version 1.0
 * @since PHP 6.0
 *
 * Passes the RecursiveIterator interface to the inner Iterator and provides
 * the same functionality as FilterIterator. This allows you to skip parents
 * and all their childs before loading them all. You need to care about
 * function getChildren() because it may not always suit your needs. The 
 * builtin behavior uses reflection to return a new instance of the exact same
 * class it is called from. That is you extend RecursiveFilterIterator and
 * getChildren() will create instance of that class. The problem is that doing
 * this does not transport any state or control information of your accept()
 * implementation to the new instance. To overcome this problem you might 
 * need to overwrite getChildren(), call this implementation and pass the
 * control vaules manually.
