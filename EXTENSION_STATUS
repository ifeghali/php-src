The core of PHP 3.0 is considered to be stable at this time.  However, some of
the modules that are bundled with it are still undergoing development, or
contain known bugs.  The purpose of this file is to document the status of
each module (extension).  Patches to unstable modules will be available through
the CVS, and through periodic maintenance releases.

Stability scale:
Rock solid - We believe it's safe to base a production site on it.
Stable     - It should be safe to base a production site on it.
             Isn't rated as rock-solid because it contained problems
             in the not-so-far past, or doesn't have enough users
             to test it to know it's rock solid.
Beta       - This module probably contains bugs, sometimes even known
             bugs.  You can give it a try and there's a good chance
             it'll work fine, but it might not be a good idea to base
             a production site on it.
Alpha      - This module is in initial development steps.  Don't trust
             it, play with it at your own risk.
Deprecated - This module is only available for downwards compatability,
             and will not be supported in any way.  The code quality
             is usually around the Beta status.
             
The standard disclaimers apply, that is, if a rock-solid module blows up on
you and ruins your site, nobody in the PHP development team is responsible.
We'll probably try to help, though.

                                        The flatfile support is probably not
                                        as stable.
